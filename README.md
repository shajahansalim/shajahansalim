## About Me

I work in the space where code meets reality, the part where systems either survive real traffic… or don’t.

I’m a **DevOps & Cloud Engineer** with **4+ years of experience** operating and improving Linux and AWS-based **production environments** inside large enterprises. My day-to-day work lives in CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, observability, and reliability engineering, basically the art of making systems boringly dependable.


## How I Got Here

Like many people in DevOps, I didn’t start with “DevOps” as a title.
I started with Linux, production incidents, and the uncomfortable realization that manual fixes don’t scale.

Over time, that curiosity turned into:

- Automating repeatable pain points
- Designing CI/CD pipelines that engineers can trust
- Treating infrastructure as versioned, reviewable code
- Building monitoring that explains why something broke, not just that it broke

Today, my focus is on building systems that are secure, observable, and resilient under failure not just ones that deploy successfully once.

## Featured Project

### 1. End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline for Full Stack Application – Expense Tracker  
🔗 https://github.com/shajahansalim/sjx-expense-tracker

This project exists because tutorials rarely show real DevOps.

Instead of shortcuts, this project focuses on:

- A GitHub → Jenkins → Docker → AWS EC2 delivery pipeline
- Automated builds, tests, and deployments
- Infrastructure decisions that mirror production tradeoffs
- Basic monitoring and log visibility from day one

It’s less about the app and more about the workflow, discipline, and failure paths around it.



### 2. Community Project - learnDevOps(Work in Progress)
🔗 https://github.com/shajahansalim/learnDevOps

It’s a learning roadmap designed to answer a harder question:

> What should I learn, in what order, and why—if I want to become effective at DevOps in the real world?

Learn DevOps focuses on learning strategy, not instruction.
